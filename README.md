## Psych-64

Psych-64 is a non-profit social enterprise that uses chess as a tool to help African youth overcome their fear of failure and improve their mental health and well-being. Through weekly chess training, tournaments, and other events, Psych-64 teaches participants persistence, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and embracing risks in a safe environment.

The venture incorporates journaling and anonymous surveys to track the participantsâ€™ emotions and progress over time as it supports users in developing resilience and coping strategies. 

By promoting a culture where failure is viewed as an opportunity for growth rather than a barrier, Psych-64 aims to empower African youth to build a sustainable future for themselves and their communities.

Participation in Psych-64 programs is free, with the goal of maximizing accessibility and impact. The venture generates revenue through donations, merchandising, and sponsorships to supplement grant funding.
